DataSet contains 15min candles of NSE:BANKNIFTY24FEBFUT symbol from 29th December to 25th January

T1. Calculate the exponential moving average with span 10 and 20 using ewm(span=X).mean() on the close price and add the values in the columns named "ema_10" and "ema_20" for each row (15min)
T2. Calculate the previous_day_high using max() funtion and previous_day_low using min() from the previous day for each row (15min)
T3. Calculate the ema_10 and ema_20 on close price for 5 min dataset
T4. Create a new dataset named "CE" filtering both 15min and 5min datasets above where below condition satisfies

	(i) historical_data_15min['ema_10'] > historical_data_15min['ema_20']
        (ii) close > historical_data_15min['prev_days_high']
        (iii) historical_data_5min['ema_10'] > historical_data_5min['ema_20']
        (iv) historical_data_5min['close'] > historical_data_5min['ema_10']

T5. Create a new dataset named "PE" filtering both 15min and 5min datasets above where below condition satisfies

	(i) historical_data_15min['ema_10'] < historical_data_15min['ema_20']
        (ii) close < historical_data_15min['prev_days_low']
        (iii) historical_data_5min['ema_10'] < historical_data_5min['ema_20']
        (iv) historical_data_5min['close'] < historical_data_5min['ema_10']

T6. Exclude all the rows of "CE" and "PE" which are before start_time = "9:45:00" and after stop_time = "15:00:00"

T7. Calculate stike price and add a cloumn named "strike" for each row of CE using below formula
    strike = round(float(close_price), -2) - 200
  
    Calculate string symbol and add a cloumn named "symbol" of each row of CE using below formula
    symbol = "NSE:BANKNIFTY24FEB" + str(strike) + "CE"
 
T8. Calculate stike price add a cloumn named "strike" for each row of PE using below formula
    strike = round(float(close_price), -2) + 200

    Calculate string symbol and add a cloumn named "symbol" of each row of PE using below formula
    symbol = "NSE:BANKNIFTY24FEB" + str(strike) + "PE"

T9. list all the unique symbols for CE and PE

T10. For each row in CE, buy the "symbol" at the close price from the symbol dataset at the same timestamp.
    and then try to sell it when below condition satisfies:
     i) got 10 point price gain ( type point_gain)
     ii) when 1_min_close < 1min_ema_20 ( type 1min_ema20)
     iii) reached a threshold time of 15min ( type threshold ) 
    capture the buy_price, sell_price, sell_type(point_gain, 1min_20ema or threshold) ce_sell and profit_or_loss for each row of CE

T11. For each row in PE, buy the "symbol" at the close price from the symbol dataset at the same timestamp.
    and then try to sell it when below condition satisfies:
     i) got 10 point price gain ( type point_gain)
     ii) when 1_min_close > 1min_ema_20 ( type 1min_ema20)
     iii) reached a threshold time of 15min ( type threshold )
    capture the buy_price, sell_price, sell_type(point_gain, 1min_20ema or threshold) and profit_or_loss for each row of PE
